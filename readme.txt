--Readme document for JENNET DILEKCHI, JDILEKCH@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

- I added two images with descriptive alt
- I added headings and paragraph texts in total 3 pages
- I have multiple links to external pages
- I added semantic html tags: footer, section, main

(b) CSS features

- I added a custom Google font for ex. "Lato" to make it less basic
- I added 2 custom colors to make it more visually appealing
- Spacing in certain sections and padding

(c) Advanced features
- I added a simple contact form in Contact page

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

- My portfolio passed all accessibility tests. At first I had 1 warning and 2 errors in some of the files. I fixed them all so now they're passing. 

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

- Going through tutorials about basics of html took me around a week as I don't have any prior experience in front-end. But the project took me about 4.5 days.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I watched a couple of videos in the beginning of the class to get an idea, such as:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8FP8ear2Y
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oCN2q1x3c4&pp=ygUZaHRtbCBiYXNpY3MgZm9yIGJlZ2lubmVycw%3D%3D 
- https://www.udemy.com/course/free-html-css-for-beginners/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8&pp=ygUiaHRtbCBiYXNpY3MgZm9yIGJlZ2lubmVycyBicm8gY29kZdIHCQlPCgGHKiGM7w%3D%3D

- I also revisitted lecture slides and recordings

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

- N/A because I don't have any friends or people I know well in this class

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
- N/A
